* Program can build and run
* Program can calculate average wind speed and standard deviation for a specific month and year
* Program can calculate average wind temperature and standard deviation for every month of the year 
* Program can calculate average wind solar radiation for every month of the year
* Program can read and record the data into a struct.
* Program can calculate average wind speed, temperature and their standard deviation and also the solar radiation 
and print it out into a csv file name WindTempSolar.csv
* Program loops the menu prompt properly
* Program correctly reads the correct csv file to bread
* Program correctly converts the solar radiation values from
W/m^2 to kWh/m^2


- Program cannot simplify the solar radiation values so that
only solar radiation values of >=  100 W/m^2 are to be used
