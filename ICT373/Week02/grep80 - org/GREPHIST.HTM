<h2 id="V8.0">Release 8.0, 5 May 2005</h2>


<p class="brk">New features:</p><ul>

<li> The new letter <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptO"><kbd>/o</kbd> option</a> lets you specify
output format independent of input format.
<p class="nonbrk"><strong class="key">Compatibility note:</strong> Release 8.0
changes the default output format for text lines (not paragraphs).
Earlier releases simply dumped the input lines na&iuml;vely. Release 8.0
displays control characters in <samp>^<var>letter</var></samp> format
and other non-printing characters in <samp>&lt;<var>nn</var>&gt;</samp>
format. In most cases this is a good thing, but if you want the old
behavior specify the <kbd>/o1</kbd> option on the command line or in the 
<a href="grepman.htm#R5.1.2-Envvar">environment variable</a>.</p>
</li>


<li> The functions that read text files were
completely overhauled. Now GREP recognizes line terminators in DOS,
UNIX, or Macintosh-format files; and Control-Z and NUL are treated
like any other characters. This affects paragraph mode
(<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptG"><kbd>/G2</kbd> option</a>) and both line modes (<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptG"><kbd>/G0</kbd> or <kbd>/G1</kbd> option</a>).
I'm grateful to Scott Brueckner
for an excellent set of
<a href="http://www.mrx.net/c/input.files.html">test cases</a> in his
<a href="http://www.mrx.net/c/index.html"><cite>Reading Text Files in
C</cite></a>. Although I didn't use any of his C code, I did benefit
greatly from his research into the issues with the standard C library.
<p class="nonbrk">With the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptG"><kbd>/G0</kbd> option</a> (fixed-width text lines), earlier
releases of GREP would chop the line into chunks of <var>txwid</var>+1
characters as specified in the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptW"><kbd>/W</kbd> option</a>;
release 8.0 chops the line into chunks of exactly
<var>txwid</var> characters.</p></li>

<li> The <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptP"><kbd>/P</kbd> option</a> (show context lines)
was previously illegal with
the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptR"><kbd>/R3</kbd> option</a>. Now, <kbd>GREP32&nbsp;/J&nbsp;/R3&nbsp;/P<var>b,a</var></kbd>
supplies context in bytes, up to
<var>b</var> bytes before and <var>a</var> bytes after. (The 
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptJ"><kbd>/J</kbd> option</a> is required.)</li>

<li> When GREP prompts you to enter input files,
regexes, or input lines at the keyboard, it now tells you the maximum
length of input allowed.</li>

<li> The exit status is now displayed with the
numbers of hits and files.</li>

<li> If you specify the new <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-Opt3"><kbd>/3</kbd> option</a>, then
GREP will set the return value to 3 if there are warnings but no
errors.</li>

<li> The debug message (<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptD"><kbd>/D</kbd> option</a>) at the end
of each file now gives you both the item count and the line or byte
count.</li>

</ul>
<p class="brk">Bugs fixed:</p><ul>

<li> Two long-standing bugs in basic regexes
(unnoticed since May 2000!) were
discovered and fixed:
the regex <kbd>.*</kbd> wasn't matching an empty line, as it should;
and the naked dollar sign <kbd>$</kbd>, which should match every line,
wasn't matching any.
(Extended regexes, <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptE"><kbd>/E2</kbd> option</a>, were not implicated.)</li>

<li> Release 7.5, if you used the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptU"><kbd>/U</kbd> option</a>,
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptN"><kbd>/N</kbd> option</a>, <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptR"><kbd>/R2</kbd> option</a>, and <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptP"><kbd>/P</kbd> option</a> all used
together, failed to distinguish visually between records that contain
matches and records displayed for context. As in previous releases, in
release 8.0 a colon follows the file name only for the records that
contain matches.</li>





</ul>
<p class="brk">Other program changes:</p><ul>

<li> With the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptN"><kbd>/N</kbd> option</a> in paragraph mode
(<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptG"><kbd>/G2</kbd> option</a>), GREP now displays the line number 
followed in
parentheses by the paragraph number.
Also with the <kbd>/N</kbd> option, byte numbers from
free-format binary files (<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptR"><kbd>/R3</kbd> option</a>) are now prefixed with B
to distinguish them from line numbers.</li>

<li> The <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptX"><kbd>/X</kbd> option</a> exclusions now apply only to
input filespecs that contain wildcards. The idea is that if you
explicitly specify a single file without wildcards, you must want GREP
to process it. (Previously, if the 
<a href="grepman.htm#R5.1.2-Envvar">environment variable</a> contained
<kbd>/X*txt</kbd> and you typed <kbd>grep&nbsp;warning&nbsp;prog.txt</kbd> on
the command line, GREP would ignore the prog.txt input file because it
matched the exclusion.)</li> 

<li> The pseudo-file <kbd>NUL</kbd> is now ignored.
(Previously, GREP interpreted it as an interactive device.)</li>

<li> When input is
<a href="grepman.htm#R2.2-InputStandard">redirected from file or piped
from another command</a>, GREP now ignores the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptR"><kbd>/R</kbd> option</a>.</li>

<li> The binary buffer size (<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptW"><kbd>/W</kbd> option</a>)
must be an even number
with the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptR"><kbd>/R3</kbd> or <kbd>/R-1</kbd> or <kbd>/R-2</kbd> option</a>.
Previously, GREP enforced this requirement by means of a fatal error.
Now, GREP displays a level-1 warning, adjusts the binary width to the
next even number, and continues.</li>

<li> With fixed-length records (<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptR"><kbd>/R2</kbd> option</a>),
GREP now warns you if the last record is short, which could mean the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptW"><kbd>/W</kbd> option</a> option wasn't specified correctly.</li>

<li> The warning "^ and $ are not recommended in
a basic regex with /R3" (or /R&#8722;1 or /R&#8722;2) was
eliminated because it didn't always appear when it should and often
appeared where it shouldn't.</li>


<li> The nag message at the beginning of the
unregistered version was shortened.</li>

</ul>
<p class="brk">Documentation changes:</p><ul>

<li> The help message (<kbd>grep&nbsp;/?</kbd>)
is now much more explicit about
the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-Opt0"><kbd>/0</kbd> or <kbd>/1</kbd> option</a>,
and reserved modes /G3 and higher are no longer mentioned. The
placement of "(default)" is now uniform.</li>

<li> The interactive tour never got thoroughly tested
under Windows XP because I didn't have free access to an XP system
until early 2005.
Caret (<kbd>^</kbd>) characters in regexes were a particular problem. Now the
tour should work in DOS 5.0 through Windows XP.</li>

<li>The <a href="grepman.htm#desktop"><cite>GREP Manual</cite></a> now explains how
to run GREP from the Windows desktop.</li>

<li> In the <cite>GREP Manual</cite>, the terms
<a href="grepman.htm#stdin">standard input</a>,
<a href="grepman.htm#stdout">standard output</a>, and
<a href="grepman.htm#stderr">standard error</a> are now defined;
and uses of those
terms are cross referenced to the definitions.
Similarly, the
<cite>GREP Manual</cite> now defines <a href="grepman.htm#whitespace">whitespace
characters</a>; and uses of the terms
<a href="grepman.htm#hits">hits</a>,
<a href="grepman.htm#filespec">filespec</a>,
and
<a href="grepman.htm#wildcard">wildcard</a> now link to the
definitions of those terms.</li>

<li> The 0README.1ST file was reorganized, and a few
usage notes were added.</li>



</ul>



<h2 id="v7.52">Release 7.52, 17 Jan 2005</h2>

<p class="brk">The TOURKEY program (see <a href="#v7.51">release 7.51</a>)
was compiled with a 16-bit compiler to keep it small. It worked fine
on my Windows XP Pro, but a user reported that it didn't work on his.
I recompiled it with a 32-bit compiler. Also, though TOURKEY isn't
intended for standalone use, I added a program identification  and
help message if you run it with the <kbd>/?</kbd> option.</p>

<p class="brk">In the tour itself, I simplified the regex used with GREP32 to
illustrate paragraph mode .</p>

<p class="brk">The GREP executables and the other documentation are unchanged
from <a href="#v7.5">release 7.5</a>.</p>


<h2 id="v7.51">Release 7.51, 29 Dec 2004</h2>

<p class="brk">Following a report that the tour didn't work in Windows&nbsp;XP, I
investigated and found that the default installation of Windows&nbsp;XP
doesn't have the CHOICE program, which the tour uses to get
instructions from the user. I wrote a workalike, TOURKEY, which is now
included with the distribution.</p>

<p class="brk">The executables and documentation are unchanged.</p>

<h2 id="v7.5">Release 7.5, 19 Dec 2004</h2>

<p class="brk">Program changes affecting <strong class="key">text files</strong>:</p><ul>

<li>The new <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptG"><kbd>/G2</kbd> option</a> makes GREP
<strong class="key">search paragraphs rather than lines</strong>.
This is very handy for text files where a match might begin on
one line and end on a later line; it's also a more flexible way to
show context than the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptP"><kbd>/P</kbd> option</a>.</li>

<li>You no longer need to preset the text width (first number in the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptW"><kbd>/W</kbd> option</a>): GREP now allocates memory dynamically to take in
<strong class="key">any length of text line</strong>.
(This change affects GREP16 users much more than GREP32 users, because
the default line length was already very large in GREP32.)
If you really want the old behavior, where GREP chops lines in the
middle at the stated width, use the new <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptG"><kbd>/G0</kbd> option</a>.</li>

<li>Large text files should now be processed <strong class="key">about 16% faster</strong>
than before.
(I benchmarked read speeds for pairs of identical 7&nbsp;MB files
that, to the best of my understanding, were not cached.)</li>

</ul>

<p class="brk">Program changes in the handling of <strong class="key">multiple regexes</strong>
(<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptF"><kbd>/F</kbd> option</a>) with the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptJ"><kbd>/J2</kbd> or <kbd>/J3</kbd> option</a>:</p><ul>

<li>GREP now <strong class="key">reports all matches in the order they occur</strong> on
the input line. (Previously, within any given line or buffer GREP
first reported all matches for the first regex in the /F file, then
all matches for the second regex, and so on.)</li>

<li>With multiple regexes, the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptJ"><kbd>/J2</kbd> option</a> (display all matching
parts of the line, without overlaps) was documented in release 7.4 to
report overlaps of matches for different regexes but not overlaps of
matches for the same regex. Now, <kbd>GREP&nbsp;/J2</kbd> won't display a
given part of the input more than once, even if it matches more than
one regex.</li>
</ul>
<p class="secondhalf">The above two changes don't affect single regexes with the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptJ"><kbd>/J2</kbd> or <kbd>/J3</kbd> option</a>.</p>

<p class="brk">Other program changes:</p><ul>

<li>There is a <strong class="key">new format for binary output</strong>, a change that was
overwhelmingly favored in a GREP user poll. Previously,
binary output was the same as text output except that non-printable
characters were replaced by a hex representation in
<samp>&lt;&nbsp;&gt;</samp> angle brackets. Now,
<a href="grepman.htm#R2.4.2-BinaryHits">binary output</a> shows
a hex dump and text representation side by
side; with non-printable characters represented by dots.</li>

<li><strong class="key">Line numbers and <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptC"><kbd>/C</kbd> option</a> counts</strong> can now go as high as
2<sup>32</sup>&#8722;1, which is 4,294,967,295 (an unsigned long),
after which they will silently roll over to 0. Previously, GREP16
counts went to 32,767 and GREP32 counts went to 2,147,483,647, after
which they silently rolled over to negative numbers. (Thanks to Scott
McEndree for the suggestion.)</li>

<li>Prompts are now written to the standard error output.
This affects prompts for regexes (<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptF"><kbd>/F-</kbd> option</a>) and files
(<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptAt"><kbd>/@-</kbd> option</a>) and lines to test (if no input files are
specified). Previously they were written to the C
library "console", which on some systems gets redirected along with
standard output.</li>

<li>In the <strong class="key">debug output</strong> (<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptD"><kbd>/D</kbd> option</a>), messages about memory
allocation are now headed "grep GA". Previously they were distributed
among the other categories.</li>

<li>Some warnings about combinations of command-line options used to
be displayed before the program logo. Now the logo is displayed
first.</li>

<li>The unregistered version now displays a
<strong class="key">request for feedback</strong> at the end of execution.
Also, about one time in a hundred it
requires a keypress at the start of execution.</li>

</ul>


<p class="brk">Documentation changes (in addition to descriptions of the
program changes):</p><ul>

<li>Thanks to Matthew Miner, the download now includes a
<strong class="key"><cite>Quick Reference Card</cite></strong> for GREP. The MS-Word file GREPQRC.DOC
prints on A4 or 8&frac12;&#215;11 paper.</li>

<li>The interactive demo, TOUR.BAT, used to fail if you renamed
grep32.exe or grep16.exe to grep.exe as the
<a href="grep101.htm#Installation"><cite>GREP Quick Start</cite></a>
recommends; now the tour runs. Ilustrations of
the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptG"><kbd>/G2</kbd> option</a> and the new binary format are now included.</li>

<li>A new chapter called <a href="grepman.htm#R8-Future">Future
Directions</a> was added to the <cite>GREP Manual</cite>.</li>

<li>A note was added to the <cite>GREP Manual</cite> about
<a href="grepman.htm#N20041115">optimizing the order of multiple regexes</a>
in a file.</li>

<li><a href="grepman.htm#R7.2-redirectoutput05">Redirecting output
with &gt;<var>outputfile</var> makes GREP hang up!</a> was added to
the Troubleshooting and How-To section of the <cite>GREP Manual</cite>.</li>

<li>The questions in the
<a href="grepman.htm#R7-QandA">Troubleshooting and How-To</a> section
of the <cite>GREP Manual</cite> are now listed in the table of contents.</li>

<li>At a user's request, the two CSS files in the distribution were
renamed to begin with GREP. If you unpack GREP over a previous
release, you should manually delete the old files print.css and
screen.css.</li>
</ul>




<h2 id="v7.41">Release 7.41, 30 Oct 2004</h2>

<p class="brk">This release fixes two bugs that were introduced in release
7.4. Both have to do with the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptJ"><kbd>/J2</kbd> or <kbd>/J3</kbd> option</a>:</p><ul>

<li>GREP&nbsp;7.4 had a problem with reading a partial buffer to
replace a partially used buffer in a binary file. This could result in
over- or under-reporting matches if you used the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptR"><kbd>/R3</kbd> option</a>
with <kbd>/J2</kbd> or <kbd>/J3</kbd>. This was not an issue if your
buffer was large enough to hold the file as recommended.</li>

<li>GREP&nbsp;7.4 counted matches wrong for all file types with the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptJ"><kbd>/J2</kbd> or <kbd>/J3</kbd> option</a>. Specifically, the counts reported with the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptC"><kbd>C</kbd> option</a> and the summary at the end were the sum of the number of
matches and the number of lines containing matches, instead of just
the number of matches. (Counts with the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptJ"><kbd>/J1</kbd> option</a> or with no
<kbd>/J</kbd> option were correct.)</li>

</ul>


<h2 id="v7.4">Release 7.4, 23 Oct 2004</h2>

<p class="brk">Program changes:</p><ul>

<li>The <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptJ"><kbd>/J</kbd> option</a> is now a numeric option
<code>/J0</code> through <code>/J3</code>. When a line, record, or
buffer contains one or more matches, you can now tell GREP to display
the entire line, only the first matching part, or every matching part
with or without overlaps.</li>

<li>The <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptY"><kbd>/Y</kbd> option</a> and <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptJ"><kbd>/J</kbd> option</a> options make no logical
sense together. Previously GREP tried to make sense of the
combination; now it's just not allowed.</li>

<li>The <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptC"><kbd>/C</kbd> option</a> and <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptK"><kbd>/K</kbd> option</a> are now allowed together.
Perhaps you might want to count matches in the file without displaying
them, but stop reading a big file if the number of hits reaches a
certain value.</li>

<li>GREP now displays a grand total of the number of
matches, number of files containing matches, and number of files
examined. (GREP with the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptL"><kbd>/L</kbd> option</a> displays the number of files
containing matches and the number of files examined.) This new
information is written to the standard error stream, so that it won't
interfere with any processing you do of the redirected output; and you
can suppress it entirely with the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptQ"><kbd>/Q</kbd> option</a>.</li>

<li>Previously, if you supplied GREP a directory name with trailing
backslash, it didn't find any matching files. Now it assumes * after a
trailing backslash in a
<a href="grepman.htm#R2.1-InputsNamed">filespec</a>.</li>

<li>The tour (TOUR.BAT) now lets you quit at any point, without
answering N to every offered demonstration.</li>

<li>bug fix: <code>GREP /R3 /J /N</code> was displaying the byte
number of the start of the buffer. Now it displays the byte number
of the start of the match, as it should.</li>

</ul>

<p class="brk">Document changes:</p><ul>

<li>The <cite>GREP Manual</cite> describes the
redesigned <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptJ"><kbd>/J</kbd> option</a>. In addition, with the new <code>/J2</code>
and <code>/J3</code> selections there are some changes to how
<a href="grepman.htm#R5-R3mode">free-format binary files</a> are read
(<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptR"><kbd>/R3</kbd> option</a>) and to the
recommended buffer width (<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptW"><kbd>/W</kbd> option</a>).</li>

<li>The <a href="grep101.htm#OptList">list of options</a> in the
<cite>GREP Quick Start</cite> now shows UNIX <code>-o</code> as equivalent to the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptJ"><kbd>/J</kbd> option</a>.</li>

<li>The <a href="grepman.htm"><cite>GREP Manual</cite></a> now warns you if you read it
without its associated CSS style sheets. They provide helpful formatting
and spacing, particularly in tables of regexes and options.</li>

</ul>



<h2 id="v7.31">Release 7.31, 8 Jul 2004</h2>

<p class="brk">Program change: Add a warning in the help message about regexes
that start with <code>-</code> or <code>/</code>, in response to a
user's question.</p>

<p class="brk">Documentation changes:</p><ul>
<li>Add the above warning to the
<a href="grepman.htm#R4.1.4-RegexConfuse"><cite>GREP Manual</cite></a> in
the section on regexes.</li>
<li>Add a <a href="grepman.htm#20040707b">quick reference table</a> of
special characters to the regex overview in the <cite>GREP Manual</cite>.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="v7.3">Release 7.3, 5 Jul 2004</h2>

<p class="brk">Program changes:</p><ul>
<li>GREP no longer strips off a pair of quotes that enclose a regex.
Recent versions of DOS appear to do this automatically, and therefore you
should see no difference in final processing. What will be different
is that now it becomes easier to specify a regex that contains quotes,
such as <code>\"something\"</code>.</li>

<li>If you specify a directory name as an input file, GREP no longer
displays a warning and ignores it, but now scans all files in that
directory.</li>

<li>Debug output was improved: command-line arguments are now
numbered, and regexes are no longer quoted in the debug output.</li>

<li>Exactly one error message, "character class never ended", ended
with a period; it's now consistent with the rest. "Unsupported locale"
became "unsupported locale in M option". "The E3 option is accepted
for E2 plus J" became "the E3 option is treated as E2 plus J".</li>
</ul>

<p class="brk">Documentation changes:</p><ul>

<li>The user guide and reference manual were reorganized from the
ground up, into a <a href="grep101.htm"><cite>GREP Quick Start</cite></a> targeted at new users
and a large self-contained <a href="grepman.htm"><cite>GREP Manual</cite></a> with full
information on all topics.
Previously, the main discussions of binary files, subdirectory
searches, and ERRORLEVEL were in the user guide, and some
discussions were split between the two documents. Now, experienced
users need search only the <a href="grepman.htm"><cite>GREP Manual</cite></a> to answer
any question.</li>

<li>For the first time in a couple of years, both documents were reread
beginning to end. A few small errors were corrected, and many
clarifications and hyperlinks were added.</li>

<li>Navigation in the <a href="grepman.htm"><cite>GREP Manual</cite></a>
should now be much easier. Sections are numbered, and each chapter now
has a table of its own contents.
The <a href="grepman.htm#FULLTOC">whacking great table of contents</a>
at the beginning was moved to the end, and at the
beginning there's now a manageable list of chapters.</li>

<li><a href="grepman.htm#R2.3-InputsSubdirs">Subdirectory Searches</a>
now explains the search order in full detail, with new examples.</li>

<li>The <a href="grepman.htm#R2.1-InputsNamed">Input Filespecs</a>
section of the <cite>GREP Manual</cite> now explains how to search a file
whose name contains a <code>[</code> character.</li>

<li>The <cite>GREP Manual</cite> now explains interactions between the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptL"><kbd>/L</kbd> option</a> and multiple
regexes, and how to find a file that contains multiple regexes not on
the same line.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="v7.2">Release 7.2, 13 Jan 2003</h2>

<p>Program changes: The latest changes from PCRE release 3.9 were adapted
into the code for the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptE"><code>/E2</code> and
<code>/E4</code> options</a>. Those changes fixed some esoteric bugs
but did not add any features. (This affects only GREP32 since those
options don't exist in GREP16, but the GREP16 release number was updated
for consistency.)</p>

<p class="brk">Documentation changes:</p><ul>

<li>In response to a user query, the reference manual clarified that
many options are toggles, and if used multiple times on the command
line will reverse themselves.

<li>The GREP*.HTM documents were styled to match the Oak Road Systems
Web site. As part of this, the style sheet ORSSW.CSS has been replaced
by the separate style sheets SCREEN.CSS and PRINT.CSS.

</ul>

<p class="brk"><strong class="key">Release 7.21, 12 Apr 2004,</strong> fixed a bug:
when the regex contained an opening [ but no closing ],
the command-line parser mistakenly diagnosed it as a bad filename
instead of a bad regex.</p>


<h2 id="v7.11">Release 7.11, 29 Apr 2002</h2>

<p>This release fixed a memory allocation bug that affected the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptE"><code>/E4</code> option</a>. For some
regexes, an internal error was generated.</p>


<h2 id="v7.1">Release 7.1, 27 Mar 2002</h2>

<p>The new <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptE"><code>/E4</code> option</a>
tells GREP to search for your regex as a word.</p>

<p>An optional second argument on the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptM"><code>/M</code> option</a> now lets
you define what is a "word" character, if you need to.</p>


<p class="brk"><strong class="key">Release 7.02, 24 Mar 2002</strong>,
was an internal checkpoint release for a few minor changes:</p><ul>

<li><p>Per user request, when you specify a list of input files with the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptAt"><code>/@</code> option</a> leading and
trailing blanks are now removed from the filespecs.</p>

<li><p>The new value 4 is returned in
<a href="grepman.htm#R3.3-ERRORLEVEL">ERRORLEVEL</a> if GREP found no
files to match any of your input filespecs. A warning message also
appears, if you specified multiple filespecs on the command line or
used the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptAt"><code>/@</code> option</a>.</p>

<li><p>The message "no files at all matched <i>filespec</i>" became "no
files exist like <i>filespec</i>". This should reduce confusion with the
(possibly normal) situation where the input file exists but none of its
lines match the regex.</p>

<li><p>The warning message "Some matches in the middle of long lines may
have been missed. You might want to try the /W<i>n</i> option" now
suggests both text and binary widths, when GREP is deciding whether
files are text or binary (<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptR"><code>/R-1</code>
or <code>/R-2</code> option</a>), This is just a clarification of the
warning message; there is no change in how GREP handles files.</p>

<li><p>The <a href="grepman.htm#R2.1.3-InputsMissing">reference manual</a>
says that, when an input filespec doesn't match any files, GREP
reminds you to check your <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptX">exclusions</a>.
In 7.0 and 7.01 the warning appeared even if you never used the
<code>/X</code> option; now it doesn't.</p>
</ul>


<h2 id="v7.01">Release 7.01, 10 Feb 2002</h2>

<p>Program changes:</p><ul>

<li><p>The warning message "the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptX">X option</a> is
useful only with named input files" is now "the X option is ignored
when reading only standard input", and is suppressed
when you have only stored <code>/X</code> options in the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5.1.2-Envvar">environment variable</a>.</p>

<li><p>The warning message "the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptR">R option</a>
applies only to named files, not standard input" now appears only when
you told GREP to read files in binary (<code>/R2</code> or
<code>/R3</code>), not when you told GREP to sense the file type
(<code>/R-1</code> or <code>/R-2</code>).</p>

<li><p>In reading text files, GREP 7.01 doesn't check for error unless
the read function returns a non-normal status. The way it was done in
7.0 was correct but wasted a very few CPU cycles.</p>

</ul>


<p>Documentation changes:</p><ul>

<li><p>In the <a href="grepman.htm#R7.1-QandARegex">Troubleshooting</a>
section of the user guide, "GREP is finding too many matches!" was
changed to "How do I search for a word?" New question "How do I find
all files that contain 'this' and 'that'?" was added.</p>

<li><p>The style sheet was developed further, and validated.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="v7.0">Release 7.0, 21 Jan 2002</h2>

<p>As promised, this release was driven by users' responses to the
poll distributed with release 6.9.</p>

<p class="brk">Program changes:</p><ul>

<li><p>Filenames have
<a href="grepman.htm#R2.1.1-InputsWildcards">more extensive
wildcards</a>. The wildcard rules were added
to the help message.</p>

<p>GREP16 users, please note that <code>ABC*</code> now means the same
thing as <code>ABC*.*</code>, namely all filenames that begin with
ABC.</p>

<li><p>You can use the new
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptAt"><code>/@</code> option</a> to give GREP a
file list in a file, when a program generates your list of input files
or there are simply too many for the command line.</p>

<li><p>You can use the new
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptX"><code>/X</code> option</a> to exclude
filenames that match certain patterns.</p>

<li><p>The
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptK"><code>/K</code><i>count</i> option</a> was
added, to tell GREP to stop reading each file after reporting the
first <i>count</i> matches.</p>

<li><p>When no input files are named, and
input is from the keyboard (not redirected from file), GREP now
prompts you to enter each line. Previously, it just sat there and waited
for you to realize your mistake.</p>

<li><p>The message prompting you for regexes
(<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptF"><code>/F-</code> option</a>) is now
written directly to the console, not to standard error (which could be
redirected in some operating systems.) And a prompt appears for each
regex after the first.</p>

<li><p>The text of several error and warning
messages was tweaked slightly for consistency, and the help text was
expanded a bit more. Customized text was removed from all
"insufficient memory" messages, in favor of automatically generated
file and line numbers.</p>

</ul>

<p>Documentation changes:</p><ul>

<li><p>A complete list of <a href="grepman.htm#R6-Messages">GREP's
warnings and error messages</a>, with explanations, was added to the reference
manual.</p>

<li><p>The description of
<a href="grep101.htm#User">command line syntax</a> was overhauled.
<a href="grep101.htm#Inputs">Input redirection</a> was clarified,
and a section was added on <a href="grep101.htm#Outputs">output
redirection</a>. The description of
<a href="grep101.htm#InputsNamed">named input files</a> was greatly
simplified, with the detailed (and new) rules moved to the
<a href="grepman.htm#R2.1-InputsNamed">reference manual</a>.</p>

<li><p>The HTML versions now use an
experimental style sheet, which should make them slightly more
attractive on your screen.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="v6.9">Release 6.9, 22 Dec 2001</h2>

<p>This was a pre-release of 7.0. A poll distributed with this
release asked users to indicate which requested features they would
like to see in the program.</p>

<p class="brk">Program changes:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>Binary file modes have been completely overhauled. The old
<code>/R</code> toggle has been replaced by a mode selection
via the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptR"><code>/R2</code> option</a>
for record-oriented binary or the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptR"><code>/R3</code> option</a>
for free-format binary. This solves a known but serious problem
with the old binary mode, where a match would be missed if it
crossed a block boundary.</p>

<li><p>The new <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptR"><code>/R-1</code> or
<code>/R-2</code> option</a> lets you tell GREP to figure out on its
own whether each input file is text or binary. (<code>/R-1</code> and
<code>/R-2</code> are available only with the registered version.)</p>

<li><p>You can now specify different widths for binary blocks and text
lines with the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptW"><code>/W</code> option.</a>
The <code>/W</code> option minimum value, formerly 10 characters, is
now 2.</p>

<li><p>(GREP32 only) The new <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptM"><code>/M</code>
option</a> allows correct
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptI">case-blind matching</a> and
<a href="grepman.htm#R4.7.4-RegexClassName">character classes</a> with
non-English letters and other 8-bit characters.
(A test file is included.)
Binary output now displays the hex value
<code>&lt;<i>nn</i>&gt;</code> for every non-printing character,
according to the current character set
(<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptM"><code>/M</code> option</a>).</p>

<li><p>A new demo file, TOUR.BAT, is included.</p>

<li><p>The new <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptJ"><code>/J</code> option</a>
tells GREP to display from each line only the portion that matched the
search string, basic regex, or extended regex. In release 6.0, this
was added for extended regexes only, and you specified the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptE"><code>/E3</code> option</a>. <code>/E3</code>
is still allowed, but is equivalent to <code>/E2 /J</code>.</p>

<li><p>In record-oriented binary files
(<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptR"><code>/R2</code> option</a>),
the <a href="grepman.htm#R4.8-RegexAnchor"><code>^</code>
anchor</a> at the start and <a href="grepman.htm#R4.8-RegexAnchor"><code>$</code>
anchor</a> at the end of a basic regex now mean the start and end of
block, for better consistency with extended regexes.</p>

<li><p>GREP is now about 5% faster on text files, and NUL (ASCII 0) will
no longer cause the rest of a line to be ignored.</p>

<li><p>With the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptL"><code>/L</code> option</a>,
GREP now stops reading a file as soon as it finds a match, unless the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptV"><code>/V</code> option</a> is also set.</p>

<li><p><a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptD">Debug output</a> now includes
additional information:<ul>
<li>per-file execution time and number of lines/records/buffers read
<li>the maximum line length of any individual text file that exceeds
the <i>txwid</i> in the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptW"><code>/W</code> option</a>
<li>total execution time, number of files scanned, and number of
files that contained matches
<li>the compiled form of extended regexes
<li>blank lines and dashes at the start of debug output when
written to a real file
<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li><p>Bug fix: Release 6.0 began diagnosing
wildcard filespecs that produce no files at all, even when the
<code>/S</code> (subdirectory) option is set. Unfortunately, the code
to do that broke the previous code that diagnosed missing single
files. The code to check the various cases is now collected in one
place, and diagnosis should be correct and complete.</p>

<li><p>Bug fix: The numeric values of the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptQ"><code>/Q</code> option</a> were added to
debug output and the help message, where they should have been for
release 6.0.</p>

</ul>

<p>Documentation changes (in addition to those driven by the above program
changes):</p><ul>

<li><p>The user guide had grown more and more unwieldy. All the
details of options and regexes are now split off into a separate
<a href="grepman.htm">reference manual</a>, which is included in the
download file but not published on the Web.</p>

<li><p>A <a href="grep101.htm#Options">table of options</a> with
one-line descriptions and a <a href="grep101.htm#Regex">summary of
regexes</a> were added to the user guide; both are hyperlinked to
sections in the reference manual. This may make it easier to find the
feature you need.</p>

<li><p>Information on <a href="grepman.htm#R4.6.1-RegexGreedy">greedy and
ungreedy quantifiers</a> was added to the reference manual and to the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptHelp">help message</a>.</p>

<li><p>The groups of options in the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5-Options">reference manual</a> and the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptHelp">help message</a> were rearranged to
input, pattern-matching, output, and general.</p>

<li><p>The writeups of several options in the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptHelp">help message</a> were expanded.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="v6.0">Release 6.0, 8 Sep 2001</h2>

<p>Note: There were beta test releases numbered 5.95, 5.97, and
5.98. For users who participated in the beta test, a number in
parentheses indicates the release where a particular change was made.</p>

<p class="brk">Program changes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(5.95) The big news is the addition of <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptE">extended
regular expressions</a>. GREP can now handle constructs like
alternatives |, optionals ?, general quantifiers {...},
subexpressions (...), and more. With extended regexes, you can choose
whether GREP reports matching lines as usual, or just the portion of
each line that matches the extended regex.</p>

<li><p>(5.95) You can now bypass regular expressions entirely and just
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptE">search for literal text</a>.</p>

<li><p>(5.97) You can now turn the
<a href="grepman.htm#R4.12-RegexCmdLine">Special Rules for the Command
Line</a> on and off.</p>

<li><p>(5.98) You now have finer-grained control over warning messages
with numeric levels for the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptQ"><code>/Q</code>
option</a>.</p>

<li><p>(5.97) GREP now displays a
warning message for any file spec that matches no files, even if the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptS"><code>/S</code> option</a> (search
subdirectories) is on.</p>

<li><p>(5.97) You can now put a plus sign
after an option to turn it on (as opposed to toggling it). Example:
repeated <code>/N</code> will flip the option between on and off, but
<code>/N+</code> turns on the option regardless of any previous
settings.</p>

<li><p>(5.98) Character types and assertions were added to the
help message.</p>

<li><p>(5.95) When you put a regex on the command line, you may need to
enclose it in quotes, and if you do then GREP strips them (as past
releases did). But, in agreement with the user guide, it no longer
does that with regexes entered in a file or at the keyboard
(<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptF"><code>/F</code> option</a>).</p>

<li><p>(5.95) Two bugs in parsing oddly constructed character classes
were fixed.
(1)&nbsp;If you had a regex like <code>[]abc]</code>, GREP
wrongly took the first square bracket as ending the class. GREP now
correctly treats a ] at the beginning of a character class as an
ordinary character.
(2)&nbsp;A minus sign at the end of a class, like <code>[abc-]</code>,
is now treated correctly as a normal character.</p>

<li><p>(5.95) The user guide told you
that when your regex begins with a - or / character, you should prefix
it with a \ to keep it from being taken as an option. GREP was
considering that leading \ as part of the regex; it doesn't any
more.</p>

<li><p>(5.98) If you specify named input files and also redirected input
(&lt;<i>file</i>), GREP has always ignored the redirected input. A
warning message now appears in this case.</p>

<li><p>(5.97) The <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptZ"><code>/Z</code>
option</a> used to reset all options except <code>/F</code>; it now
resets all options as documented.</p>

</ul>

<p>User guide changes:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>(5.95) The section on <a href="grepman.htm#R4-Regex">regular
expressions</a> was pretty much rewritten, rather than try to shoehorn
in all the stuff for extended regexes. (Only about 80% of the syntax of
extended regular expressions was added to the user guide, though all
is supported in the program. For a complete description, the relevant
parts of the <a href="pcre.htm">PCRE man page</a> are also
included.)</p>

<li><p>(5.95) A section on <a href="grepman.htm#R7-QandA">troubleshooting</a> was
added.</p>

<li><p>(5.97) The section on the <a href="grepman.htm#R5.1.2-Envvar">environment
variable</a> now makes clear that the <code>/Z</code> option resets all
options including <code>/D</code> and <code>/F</code>.</p>

<li><p>(5.97) The section on <a href="grepman.htm#R4.12-RegexCmdLine">Special Rules
for the Command Line</a> was reorganized to make it clearer when you do
and don't need the rules, and information was added on the new ability
to turn them on and off.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="v5.33">Release 5.33, 19 Aug 2001</h2>

<p>This is a repackaging for Simtel; there are no significant functional
changes.</p>

<h2 id="v5.32">Release 5.32, 20 May 2001</h2>

<p>If you specified current directory on another disk, such as "d:*.htm",
GREP was taking that as root directory, "d:\*.htm". Apparently no one
but the program author ever does such a thing!</p>

<h2 id="v5.31">Release 5.31, 18 April 2001</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, a bug was introduced in release 5.3: under certain
circumstances, GREP got confused about whether it was working from
standard input or input files. This release corrects that bug, with my
apologies to everyone who downloaded the buggy 5.3. </p>

<h2 id="v5.3">Release 5.3, 17 April 2001</h2>
<p>New features: <ul>
<li>The new <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptY"><code>/Y</code> option</a> lets you search
for lines that contain multiple regexes in any order.
<li>The <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptD"><code>/D</code> option</a> now allows the pseudo
filename "-", for debugging display on standard output.
<li>Options can now appear anywhere on the <a href="grep101.htm#User">command
line</a>, not just before the first file spec.
</ul>

<p class="secondhalf">Other changes:</p><ul>
<li>If the <a href="grepman.htm#R4-Regex">regex</a> began with a
single or double quote but did not end with one, GREP formerly assumed you
meant to put it in quotes but forgot the closing quote. Now, it
interprets the quote mark as the first character of the regex.
<li>If GREP detects an internal error, it returns 128 in
<a href="grepman.htm#R3.3-ERRORLEVEL">ERRORLEVEL</a> instead of 252.
<li>Two facilities for "canning" GREP parameters are now restricted to
the registered version of the program:
the <a href="grepman.htm#R5.1.2-Envvar">environment variable</a> and
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptF">multiple regexes from file</a>. (Multiple
regexes can still be <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptF">entered "live" at the
keyboard</a>.)
<li>Some internal functions of the code were factored out into common
routines used by multiple Oak Road Systems programs. There should be
no significant change visible to users beyond the formatting of some
messages.
<li>For people who license the source code, the build procedure was
streamlined to use a single makefile.
</ul>


<h2 id="v5.2">Release 5.2, 4 Jan 2001</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the user guide, split out the <a href="grepman.htm#R5.2-OptInFile">file input
options</a> and <a href="grepman.htm#R5.3-OptPattern">pattern-matching</a> options
from the big group of <a href="grepman.htm#R5.5-OptGeneral">general options</a>, and
provide a road map to the plethora of <a href="grepman.htm#R5.4-OptOutput">output
options</a>.

<li>In the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptHelp">help message</a>,
describe the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptC">/C option</a> and
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptV">/V option</a> a bit more explicitly,
arrange the options to match the functional groups in the user guide,
and add a tip about using <code>more</code> to paginate the message.

<li>In the list of option settings (displayed if you turn on the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptD">/D option</a>),
arrange the options to match the functional groups in the user guide,
add the relevant option letter to each setting,
and show the setting of the /1 or /0 option.

<li>Replace a lot of funky macros with more straightforward functions
for displaying diagnostic messages, and clarify the text of a few
messages.

<li>Tie <a href="grep101.htm#License">certain features</a> to the
registered version of GREP. Make the logo and the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptD">debugging output</a> reflect the
registration status.
</ul>


<h2 id="v5.1">Release 5.1, 31 May 2000</h2>
<ul>
<li>fix a bug: a redundant *-expression preceding $ at the end of a regular
expression should have matched the end of line, but did not. Example: ab*$
would match ab, abb, abbb, etc. at end of line; but it did not
match an a at end of line, as it should have.
</ul>


<h2 id="v5.0">Release 5.0, 7 May 2000</h2>
<p>Program changes:</p><ul>

(formerly fixed at 255 characters), and warn the user if longer lines
were found
<li>Add the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptZ"><code>/Z</code> option</a> to reset all
options
<li>Disallow out-of-order <a href="grepman.htm#R4.7.1-RegexClassMinus">character ranges</a>
like <code>z-a</code>; previously they were silently treated like the three
characters "z", "-", "a"
<li>Add new <a href="grepman.htm#R3.3-ERRORLEVEL">return values</a> 2 and 252-254
<li>Expand the treatment of regular expressions in the
<a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptHelp">help message</a>
<li>Send the <a href="grepman.htm#R5x-OptHelp">help message</a> to stdout instead of stderr
as previously
<li>Don't display the help screens when the user types
<code>grep</code> with no options or regular expression; instead,
suggest using <code>grep&nbsp;/? |more</code>
<li>In debug mode, add more trace messages for opening input files
<li>When displaying a regular expression in debug mode, use a numeric
to show number of members in a character class
<li>Fix bug in 4.5: if you used wildcards with drive but no directory,
e.g. <code>d:*</code>, the drive was ignored
</ul>

<h2 id="v4.5">Release 4.5, 25 Sep 1999</h2>
<p>Program changes:</p><ul>

with adjacent escaped 8-bit character ranges, were not expanded
correctly
<li>Systematize the debugging output somewhat, in the course of fixing the
preceding bug
<li>Fix a bug: on the command line, <code>\e</code> in regular
expressions was expanded to
Control-W (octal 27) instead of Escape (decimal 27)
</ul>

<p>User guide changes:
Clarify and expand
"Special rules for the command line"
section of the user guide,
clarify the descriptions of
the <code>/D</code> and <code>/I</code> options,
