What works:
All my functions for each class behaves as expected.

What does not work:
I am unsure of the algorithm for converting Solar Radiation from w/m2 to kWH/m2 is correct.

I made it easy for the Evaluator to check each class because in the UnitTest Folder I made 
a folder for each class that I tested (excluding the Menu class).

The Test Files have no codeblock project file and the evaluator.
