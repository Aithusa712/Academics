Evaluation:

Test Plan - I did not use my main application to produce a test plan. I tested each module instead using small datasets
that I hardcoded into my UnitTest folder. I did this so I can accurately check if the calculations in my program are 
correct, I copy and paste the datasets I used into websites to check for correct calculations, I also did manaual 
calculations of my own and compared it to the website calculations and the calculations in my program. I can assure
that the modules used in the Unit Test is the exact same as the main application. My rationale for not testing the main
application is that by hardcoding the data, I can be sure that the module works and if it is correct in smaller dataset
I am sure that the calculations in much larger datasets are correct.

What works:
- My program functionally works.
- Each module especially the calculation module works as expected.
- Error Handling for user misinput works.
- Bst and Map data structure are implemented in my program.
- Wrapped the std map into my own Map class.
- Filehandling works.
- When reading each line in a file, program will not break if a line is blank or value contains the string "N/A", 
or is blank.
- Successfully can print contents into a WindTempSolar.csv file.
- Doxygen comments are present in the .h file.
- Doxygen output  is in the html folder.
- executable is in the executable folder.

What does not work:
- I cannot find a situation in my program that can use a Map data structure effectively. The map data structure can be
replaced by so many other data structures because I do not actually use key value pairs, the Map in my data is always 
Map<int, float> when inserting data into my map wrapper, I always use .Size() (which returns the size of the map in int
value. My program from top to bottom does not require the use of a key value pair. Sensor records have an 
overloaded <,>,== operator to allow my BST to sort each date and my Map is simply there to store data which does not need
to be sorted data because it is already filtered during insertion via BST traversal.
