Complete Topic 9, if not already completed, then go through the PowerPoint files in Content.

The lab for topic 9 is assessed in class.

Please ensure that all classes that you write have separation of interface from implementation. This is a mandatory requirement just as before. See AV rule 39 and example in the appendix (JSF-AV C++ rules in pdf document provided.). See all other rules highlighted in the pdf document.


Step 1:
Go through any of Bucky's tutorials that you didn't complete
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83


Use codeblocks and do the tutorials instead of just watching the video.

In a number of cases, you are being asked to view and do the tutorial 
more than once. If you have already understood, you can skip the 
particular video tutorial.

By now, you would have experienced that that everything is more complicated. 
So if you have skipped any work from before, go back and complete.


Step 2:
Go through the Content slides. 

Read the textbook chapters listed at the end of the slides - In a number of cases, you are being asked to read a particular chapter more than once because they are important. If you have already understood the chapter, you can skip.


Step 3:
Start on  LabExcTopic10 in the Practical Folder. This lab is is preparing you for the data structures code requirements of assignment 2. Follow the instructions given in the lab exercise. Data for assignment 2 is provided to you.

Be mindful of the advice given in the lab document. It is preparation 
for the project/assignment 2. 

Once you have completed the above, you are ready for the next topic.

If you have not understood something, make note of it to discuss during the 
class/clinic where you meet the lecturer.

Ask early. Aim to ask whatever you need to ask by the end of the second
last week of semester/trimester.
